## Overview
This app will be using a Market API from Yahoo Finance to watch the stock market in real-time and allow the user to create a watch list to keep a closer eye on the investments they would like.

The app will be styled in the Mobile-First approach, utilizing Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and React/Redux. All the styling will be accomplished through CSS.
